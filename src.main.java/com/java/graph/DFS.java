/*
You are given N towns (1 to N). All towns are connected via unique directed path as mentioned in the input.
Given 2 towns find whether you can reach the first town from the second without repeating any edge.
B C : query to find whether B is reachable from C.
Input contains an integer array A of size N and 2 integers B and C ( 1 <= B, C <= N ).
There exist a directed edge from A[i] to i+1 for every 1 <= i < N. Also, it's guaranteed that A[i] <= i for every 1 <= i < N.
NOTE: Array A is 0-indexed. A[0] = 1 which you can ignore as it doesn't represent any edge.
